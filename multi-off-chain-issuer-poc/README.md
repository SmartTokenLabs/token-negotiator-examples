# token issuer overlay

The token issuer overlay provides a gateway to negotiate tokens from the token outlet to the client. This can be thought of as an access driven relay between the client to the outlet.

For illustrative demo purposes this current example combines the outlet and overlay components. However in future it will be required to host the outlet and overlay inside different pages, allowing more flexibility as the library is extended.
